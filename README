A complex interval library similar in flavor to mpfr and mpfi.

This is work in progress, lots of parts have not been finished yet, are just
drafts and have bugs, need clean-up, and have not been tested yet.

One goal is to implement a complex interval polylogarithm so that we can
compute verified volume of ideal tetrahedra using the Block-Wigner dilogarithm.
